# SemanticPrimeDictionary
The Semantic Prime Dictionary is a non-circular dictionary with all non-primitive words defined by primitive words and/or other words that were defined with primitives.

A bare bones Rust program is included that allows the modifying of words and their hierarchical state relative to the semantic primes. Code does not currently reject circular definitions. Suggestions for changes are welcome.

The table below lists the primes.
